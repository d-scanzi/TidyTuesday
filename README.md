My contribution repository to the [R For Data Science](https://github.com/rfordatascience) [#TidyTueasday Challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). This is a data visualization project focused on R and the [{TidyVerse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem. Each week a new dataset is provided as a base for either creating an original visualization or recreating an existing plot.

***The code for each plot is provided in the Code folder***

## Why TidyTueasday?

I have started to learn how to code using R some months ago, in preparation for my Master Degree. I am a strong supporter of opensource software and this is the reason why I picked R as a starting point. The style of this language coupled with the supporting community made me become passionate about data analysis, however, I am now forced to learn and use MATLAB for my courses and research projects. Therefore, while I have to focus on MATLAB and my projects, I decided to not give up R and keep practising it.

I decided to complete a couple of projects each month in order to improve my R skills, in particular regarding data visualization and data cleaning. Ideally, I will following these steps for each project:

1. :broom: Cleaning up the data set;
2. :abcd: Focusing on `{tidyr}` and `{dplyr}`;
3. :alembic: Preparing the data for plotting (for example adding new variables, selecting specific subgroups, etc...);
4. ::chart_with_upwards_trend: Create the plot/s.

***:no_entry_sign: No other software than R will be used for any of these projects :no_entry_sign:***

## Would you like to help me to improve?
I would love to receive constructive feedback, whether it is a shortcut for a specific operation, a tip for a better visualization or something else. Please feel free to contact me here on GitHub or through Twitter [@daniscanzi](https://twitter.com/daniscanzi).
