# TRANSIT COST PROJECT

This is the *week 2* project for 2021. The data is obtained from the [Transit Cost Project](https://transitcosts.com/about/) which states: 

*Why do transit-infrastructure projects in New York cost 20 times more on a per kilometer basis than in Seoul?
We investigate this question across hundreds of transit projects from around the world. We have created a database
that spans more than 50 countries and totals more than 11,000 km of urban rail built since the late 1990s. 
We will also examine this question in greater detail by carrying out six in-depth case studies that take a closer look at 
unique considerations and variables that aren’t easily quantified, like project management, governance, and site conditions.
The goal of this work is to figure out how to deliver more high-capacity transit projects for a fraction of the cost in countries
like the United States. Additionally, we hope that our site will be a useful resource for elected officials, planners, researchers,
journalists, advocates, and others interested in contextualizing transit-infrastructure costs and fighting for better projects.
If you have ideas and evidence about why transit costs vary so greatly from one country to the next or you just want to connect with us, 
please get in touch at info[at]transitcosts.com or click on the “Contact Us” tab. We are trying our best to get things right, but we don’t know 
everything and we will invariably make mistakes. Correct us and expand our understanding of transit-infrastructure planning, construction, and financing. We are always looking for new projects, data, corrections, resources, and feedback. 
We are a group of researchers under the umbrella of the NYU Marron Institute of Urban Management, but our team is spread across the globe. 
Our research is supported by Arnold Ventures and others.*

## Details
I decided to analyse the difference between countries in regard to:

1. Median Price per Km(in USD) of railways
2. Median Km of railways built

Regarding the plot

* In the plot the countries are ordered based on the median of kms of railways built. On top are the countries that built more.
* The grand mean for the price per km, calculated over the aviaable data, is displayed as a vertical solid line. 
* In green are virtuous countries: countries which median expenditure is lower than the grand median expenditure **and** which
median kms built is higher than the grand median of kms built. 
* In red are expensive countries: countries which median expenditure is higher than the grand median expenditure **and** which median kms built is
lower than the grand median of kms built.
